# basic-solidity-contracts
A few basic solidity contracts to experiment with, including creating an ERC-20 token (also provided as a template in Remix IDE) and developing a simple lottery game accessible by specific token holders.


# ERC20 Token
The ERC-20 standard has already been defined and explained in:
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.7/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of an ERC-20 token using Solidity and OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 implementation. It includes:

- Token minting during deployment.
- Balance checking.
- Token transfer between accounts.
- Integration-ready design for dApps and exchanges.

# Dynamic NFT Deployment
